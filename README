===== Lamp Backup Utility ====

0.2
- It nows backup the entire www folder by default, it can be changed at begining of the file

0.1
- It backups testing folders, live folders and /etc
- Exports all MySQL databases into one the backups folder.


==== Installation ====

1. Create a folder to store your backups.
2. Open backups.sh using any editor (like vim). 
3. Change the value of OUTPUTDIR to reflect the folder you just created.
4. Modify the value of DIRTOBACKUP to reflect the folder you want to backup
5. Close the file
6. Open my.cnf using any editor.
7. Input your MySQL user and password.
   - For security reasons you can create a specific user with only reading permissions.
8. Close the file
9. Run ./backups.sh

==== Crontab ====

I include a crontab example to set up this backup to run every day at 00:05 and report 
to that email address

	# m h  dom mon dow   command
	MAILTO="youremailaddress@server.com"
	5 0 * * * /root/bash_backup/backups.sh


==== TODO ====

- Add an option to rsync the folder after doing the backup
- Add an option to upload everything by FTP to another server
